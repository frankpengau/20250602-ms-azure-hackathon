# Exercise 04 - Set up Azure resources and extract data from hotel brochures

## Lab Scenario

When people are making travel plans, they often select a hotel based on the location of the hotel or the amenities that the hotel offers. Most hotel websites make it easy to search their hotels by date and location. However, it can be challenging to narrow down the list so that only hotels with specific amenities display.

Contoso wants to build a chatbot that helps potential guests find a hotel that meets their needs. For this solution, you’ll upload PDF versions of the Contoso Hotel brochures to an Azure Storage account. Then, you’ll use Azure Search service and Azure OpenAI service to scan the PDFs and extract information that a chatbot can use to respond to guest inquiries.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an Azure Blob Storage account and a storage container.
- Upload hotel brochures to the storage container.
- Create an Azure AI Search instance.
- Create an Azure OpenAI service instance and deploy models to the instance.
- Configure managed identities for the services.
- Extract data from the brochures and test the search index.
