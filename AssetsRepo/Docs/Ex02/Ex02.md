# Exercise 02 - Deploy and review the legacy Contoso Hotel app

## Lab Scenario

The legacy Contoso Hotel app was written by using Python code. App components run inside a Docker container. The app can connect to a SQL Server or PostgreSQL database (on-premises or online). 

In this exercise, you’ll deploy the legacy app to a Docker container and then run the container. You’ll provision a PostgreSQL database instance on Azure. You’ll set up and review the app, and then test the app by adding a new booking.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you'll be able to:

- Clone a GitHub repository to your local machine.
- Build a Docker container for app components.
- Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance to store Docker containers.
- Push the Docker container for the app to ACR.
- Provision a PostgreSQL database in Azure to support the app.
- Run the containerized app and populate the database.
- Review the legacy Contoso Hotel app and add a booking.

## Exercise Duration

Estimated time to complete this exercise: *45 minutes*
