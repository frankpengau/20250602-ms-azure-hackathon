# Task 01 - Clone the GitHub repository for the project to your local machine

<!--- Estimated time: 3 minutes---> 

## Introduction

The Contoso Hotel app is monolithic. Front-end components (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) and back-end components (APIs) are all deployed as a single unit. The files required to deploy the legacy app are stored in a GitHub repository. 

## Description

The key steps are as follows:

1. Clone the GitHub repository for the project to the **Downloads\ContosoHotel** folder.
2. Verify that the files are present on your local machine.

## Success Criteria

- The files for the legacy app are available in the **Downloads\ContosoHotel** folder on your machine.
