# Exercise 03 - Split and repackage the Contoso Hotel app components and deploy the updated app

To improve the scalability of the app, Contoso plans to split the front-end components (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) from back-end components (APIs). In this exercise you’ll split the components and refactor some code. Then, you’ll deploy the front-end and back-end components to separate containers. Finally, you’ll push the containers to ACR and run the updated app. 

The updated app will use the following architecture:
