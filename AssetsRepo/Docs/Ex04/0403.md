# Task 03 - Configure Azure AI Search to extract data from the brochures and test the search index

<!--- Estimated time: 10 minutes---> 

## Introduction

Azure AI Search includes a wizard that allows you to import and vectorize data. You’ll use the wizard to extract and vectorize data from the hotel brochures. As part of the wizard, you’ll create an Azure OpenAI Service instance and deploy models to the instance. You’ll use these models later in the lab to build the chatbot that lets visitors ask questions about hotels.

## Description

In this task, you’ll use Azure AI Search to import and vectorize data from the hotel brochures. You’ll then test the index.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Launch the import and vectorize data and connect to Azure Blob Storage.
1. Create an Azure OpenAI Service instance and deploy models to the instance.
1. Vectorize text from the brochures.
1. Index the data.
1. Test the index.

## Success Criteria

- You’ve successfully completed all steps in the **Import and vectorize data** wizard. 
- You’ve deployed models to an Azure OpenAI instance.
- You’ve tested the search index by using Search Explorer and can view results.
