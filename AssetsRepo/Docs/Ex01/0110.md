# Task 10 - Install Docker Desktop

<!--- Estimated time: 7 minutes---> 

## Introduction

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. As part of the lab, you’ll deploy app components to Docker containers. 

## Description

In this task, you’ll ensure that Docker Desktop is installed and install Docker Desktop if needed.

The key steps are as follows:

1. Run a command to determine whether Docker is installed.
1. Install Docker if necessary.
1. Verify that Docker is correctly installed.

## Success Criteria

- You’ve successfully installed Docker Desktop.
